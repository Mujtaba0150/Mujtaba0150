# 💫 About Me:
👏 Who am I<br>My name is Mujtaba Ali, and I am a Computer Science student strongly driven by curiosity. I have explored multiple areas of computer science, including Networking, Cybersecurity (CYS), and Automation, and I enjoy building systems that connect theory with practical, real-world applications.<br><br>Hi, I’m Mujtaba Ali — Computer Science Student<br><br>🔭 I’m currently working on<br>• Designing and building software projects with a strong focus on Python and modern development workflows.<br>• Developing backend systems and APIs using Flask and Django.<br>• Creating automation, testing, and data-collection pipelines using Selenium, Playwright, and Scrapy.<br>• Performing data processing and analysis using Pandas and NumPy.<br>• Working on embedded systems and IoT projects using Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi.<br>• Building and managing self-hosted services such as Pi-hole and Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi and Linux systems.<br>• Containerizing and deploying applications using Docker for reproducible and scalable environments.<br>• Integrating sensors, microcontrollers, and networked devices with Python-based backend services.<br>• Writing, testing, and maintaining code in VS Code for both software and hardware-driven projects.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on<br>• Open-source and research-driven projects involving Python, Flask, and Django.<br>• IoT and embedded systems projects using Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi.<br>• Automation, scraping, and testing platforms built with Selenium, Playwright, and Scrapy.<br>• Self-hosted infrastructure, smart home, and networking projects using Pi-hole, Home Assistant, and Docker.<br>• Systems that bridge hardware and software, such as sensor networks, automation controllers, and smart devices.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning<br>• Advanced backend development and API design with Django and Flask.<br>• Data handling, numerical computing, and analysis using Pandas and NumPy.<br>• Scalable web automation and data extraction techniques.<br>• Embedded programming, networking, and device control with Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi.<br>• Containerization, orchestration, and deployment workflows using Docker.<br>• Building reliable, end-to-end systems that combine microcontrollers, self-hosted services, and cloud or local backends.<br><br>💬 Ask me about<br>• Python and its ecosystem (Flask, Django, Pandas, NumPy).<br>• Web automation and scraping (Selenium, Playwright, Scrapy).<br>• Embedded systems and IoT development with Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi.<br>• Smart home and self-hosted services like Home Assistant and Pi-hole.<br>• Containerized development and deployment with Docker.<br>• Development workflows and productivity using VS Code.
